## Todo or not todo

- Implement PEG or recursive decent parser
- Pretty print Horatio AST
- Use seeded randomness to a specific NFSP program AST will always produce the
  same output.
- Check at runtime that all used vars are present on stage
- Check at compile time that all used vars are present on stage, iff the
